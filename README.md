## Technologies used
These are the technologies I have used so far to build this app.
1. Vue.js (version 3)
    * vue-router and its guards
    * vue transitions
2. anime.js
3. json-server to serve up a local json file

## Subsequent additon
1. Vue-meta to make it more SEO-frinedly
2. Prerender-spa-plugin
3. Firebase firestore as the database instead of json-server
4. Firebase storage for image storage
5. Firebase Hosting
