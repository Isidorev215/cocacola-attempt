# cocacola-attempt
This is a personal project. A self-administred test of sorts.<br>
The goal is to reproduce a **cocacola based UI/UX design moockup** I found sometime ago.<br><br>

There are numerous unnecesary animations for a real project. This is a "test your might" situation.


## Technologies used and progress
These are the technologies I have used so far to build this app.
1. Vue.js (version 3)
    * vue-router and its guards
    * vue transitions
2. anime.js
3. json-server to serve up a local json file
4. Implemented a subdomain feature for an admin page
5. Firebase Auth for Admins
6. Firebase firestore as the database instead of json-server
7. Firebase storage for images storage

## Subsequent (future) additon
1. Firestore & storage rules  
2. Vue-meta for SEO
3. Prerender-spa-plugin for SEO
4. Firebase Hosting

### n/b: This is not mobile friendly. (yet)
For now, only view on **desktop screens**
